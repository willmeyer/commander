# Commander

A simple Command pattern framework in Java.  Define commands, set up interfaces to execute them.  Interfaces include:
- an interactive command-line shell
- a web service wrapper
- hooks for others

The interactive shell includes built-in help and related features.  You can use this framework to create an application 
with a built-in shell by default, with extensibility to many other interfaces (IM, web services, etc.)
